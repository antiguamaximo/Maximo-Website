	<h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
		<p>
			Hello,<br/>
			<br/>
			Thank you for reading my "About," I hope I can retain your attention for a little more!<br/>
			<br/>
			I have previously worked in different positions, which have offered me much insight into customer support, but I enjoy IT! I dream of working for an IT company and providing my skills to a team. And what have I been doing to achieve that? Completed different courses: <b>Google IT, Support Specialist, Coursera Learn Java Course, Python Course, and Front End Course(HTML, CSS, and Javascript)</b>. Also, I want to keep adding projects my GitHub repository to display what I have been learning in these courses.<br/>
			<br/>
			Please reach out if you have any curiosity! I wish to keep learning, increasing my skills, and gaining more experience in IT-related fields.
		</p>
