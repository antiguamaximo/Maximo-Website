	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			Hello,

			Thank you for reading my "About," I hope I can retain your attention for a little more!<br/>
			<br/>
			I have previously worked in different positions, which have offered me much insight into customer support, but I enjoy IT! I dream of working for an IT company and providing my skills to a team. <br/>
			<br/>
			And what have I been doing to achieve that? Complete different courses: <bld>Google IT, Support Specialist, Coursera Learn Java Course, Python Course, and Front End Course(HTML, CSS, and Javascript)</bld>. Also, I want to keep increasing my GitHub Library to display what I have been learning.<br/>
			<br/>
			Please reach out if there is any curiosity! I might be an introvert, but I wish to keep learning, increasing my skills, and gaining more experience in IT-related fields.<br/>
		</p>
